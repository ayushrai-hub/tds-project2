### Approch1: 

1. give question.txt, and any other file(csv, img etc) to llm and ask for code and libraries to execute.

2. execute that code in python repl.

Problem: the llm writes code assuming the names on itself which gave raise to too many errors.

### Approch-2:

1. Step first is same. but instead of just whole code we are asking to write code to scrap or read all the data that is avaialable(or given).

2. now gave that question statement and the ouput data to llm again and ask for possible solution which includes:
    - if the problem is small, or chatgpt can answer that  `go ahead and do that` if not,
    - now provide the code for that and we will execute it and answer the question accordingly.
